# Extract links from logs
Links and URLs shared in the Zoom chat logs can easily get lost amid the discussions and conversations.
This python3 script prints (for the most part) the urls and links it finds in a specified chat log.

## On Windows
1. Make sure you have python3 installed. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. For convenience, you can execute the `run.bat` file and specify:
     - chat log file path
     - links output file path
     - example: `run C:\code\zoom_saved_message_log.txt C:\code\links.txt`
